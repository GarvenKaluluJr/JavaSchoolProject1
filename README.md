Step 1: Basic REST API with In-Memory Storage

Implemented TaskController, UserController, and NotificationController with required endpoints.
Tasks are stored in-memory using a List or Map (no database).
Tasks support creation, soft-delete (marked as deleted), and retrieval (all and pending).
Users can register and "login" to see their tasks and notifications.
Notifications support GET endpoints for all and pending notifications.
All endpoints return JSON responses with proper HTTP codes.
Classes are separated per OOP best practices.
